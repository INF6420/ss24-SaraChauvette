            <h1>Ghost Towns of The Upper Peninsula</h1>
                <p>Michigan's Upper Peninsula used to be known for mining and logging. Since these industries have declined, many of the cities have become ghost tonws. 
                We travel frequently to the Upper Peninsula to visit ghost towns we've seen before and to explore new locations.</p>
